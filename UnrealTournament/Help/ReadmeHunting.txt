Hunting 1.0 by Xplo <xplo@xploded.net>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation:
	When you read this you probably already have most of the installation process
	behind you. So I won't say much here. Doubleclick on the .umod file, enter your
	main UT directory in the setup program, and hit Next a few times.

Configuration:
	Under advanced options, mutators, you can set the bonus the one gets who
	kills the 'duck'. Default is 5.

Gameplay:
	When the game starts, the first person that kills someone get's the 'duck'
	(hence the name hunting :)). He will get a yellow look and whoever kills him
	gets extrapoints. But IF he gets killed his killer becomes the new duck and 
	will be hunted. To duck will slightly shine in the colour of his team to 
	prevent teammates killing their friends.

Notes:
	I have NOT tested this mutator on a netgame but i guess it should work fine.
	no guarantee :)
