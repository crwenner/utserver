=========================================
Unreal Tournament FreezeTag v1.00
=========================================

Released March 12, 2000

Description:
------------
This is a team based gametype that modifies the way frags are scored. After dealing
a killing blow to an enemy player, that player will be 'frozen'... In the frozen state,
the player cannot move or shoot until he is released by a fellow teammate.. Frozen
teammates are released by touching them. If the entire enemy team is frozen then they will
spontaneosly shatter (!gib!).. The player killing the last enemy unit will score all those
kills, and their team score will go up by one.. 

Options:
--------
The only configuration option present is the team frag limit, which is configured via
the regular method.

Network Play:
-------------
This gametype should work fine in both single and multiplay.. tested in both..

Acknowledgements:
-----------------
I got the idea for this mod from the ModCentral forums.. someone had posted the idea, but
wasn't going to develop it..
