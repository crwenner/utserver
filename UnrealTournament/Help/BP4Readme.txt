Epic Games Presents
Bonus Pack 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Happy Holidays, and thanks for downloading the official Epic Games Bonus Pack 4.

This pack contains two new player characters and 12 maps.

The characters are "Xan - Mark II," and "WarBoss."

Xan Mark II: After his defeat in the Tournament, Xan has been rebuilt from the ground up. He's stronger, faster, and a hell of a lot meaner looking. 

WarBoss: Liandri researchers have been experimenting with recently uncovered Skaarj technology and have been implementing their results in a 
new model. Dubbed "Warboss," he's the fastest and most agile robot ever produced.

These characters are higher poly than the original UT characters, so you may see a slow down on slower systems.
If these characters fail to show up properly in a network game, check the UnrealTournament.ini file (in your UnrealTournament\system directory).  
In the [Engine.GameEngine] section, there are several ServerPackages lines.   Make sure that this line is there:

	ServerPackages=SkeletalChars


CTF-Beautitude: Medium sized Ancient temple CTF.
CTF-EpicBoy: Warren Marshall's medium sized gothic themed CTF map. This map is very detailed, we suggest a fast PC for it.
CTF-Ratchet: LARGE industrial CTF map. Needs many players.
DM-Bishop: Large Gothic style DM with excellent central combat area.
DM-Closer: Industrial DM with great flow.
DOM-Bullet: Large sized Domination map.
DOM-Cidom: Small Domination map similar to Condemned.
DOM-WolfsBay: Medium sized Domination on an out of control hovercraft. This map is very detailed, we suggest a fast PC for it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This pack contains 2 maps that are built for ONE ON ONE Tournament play.

DM-Grit-TOURNEY: 1 on 1 map for competitions.
DM-Viridian-TOURNEY: 1 on 1 map for competitions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This pack also contains 2 updated UT maps.

CTF-Face-SE: A slightly modified version of the infamous Facing Worlds map. Players spawn out of sight of snipers, some teleporter fixes, etc...
DOM-Lament][: Remixed version of UT's original Lament map.
