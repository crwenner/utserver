 Climber 2000 BETA 1
---------------------

Climber2000 is a flexible grappling weapon for Unreal Tournament.  
With user-configurable range, retract speed, and hook range
it can be tailored to suite the desires of the player or system
admin.  With the "Drop Flag" option, CTF players can be prevented 
from grappling away with the flag.  Climber2000 comes with an 
Arena-style mutator (ClimberArena) that replaces the Translocator 
with the Climber2000 and an additional mutator (Climber2000) that 
simply adds a Climber2000 to each player's inventory.

Climber2000 is unique among grapplers in that it does not necessarily
retract you to a position when the hook makes contact.  When not in an
attached position, primary fire will launch a regular hook while 
secondary fire will launch an autoretracting hook.  In addition, if 
the player moves or falls out of the configured range of an attached
hook, the Climber2000 will reverse their velocity, effectively 
tethering the Player to the hook and allowing for "swinging" actions.  
This does not apply when unlimited range is set.  In order to recall 
the hook or drop from an attached position, the player must hit 
secondary fire .  If a player retracts and retrieves the hook, another
hook can be fired with primary fire and used for a "zipline" effect 
between positions.  Secondary fire allows the player to drop from an
attached position.

The gun's Indicator Light shows one of four colors to indicate the
current status of the Climber2000.  These are:

 Green - Ready State
Yellow - Hook In Transit
   Red - Hook Attached, Waiting for Retract
Purple - Retracting to Hook position

Additionally the Climber2000's hook has a user configurable limited
lifespan.  Each use of the "tethering" action at the end of the range
artificially shortens the hook's lifespan.  Hooks are vulnerable
to attack until retrieved and can be destroyed.  Each hook puts out
a visibility beacon in the color of the player's team once attached
to a wall.

Climber2000 has UWindows support and Advanced Options menu support
included.

Optional Parameters and their defaults:

Put this in your Unrealtournament.ini or primary ini file:

[Climber2000BETA1.Climber]
HookLife=120		// life of hook/attachment in seconds
HookSpeed=2000		// Travel speed of the hook
Range=6000			// range of hook (0 = unlimited)
SpeedFactor=1.5		// retract speed as a factor of running speed 
					// (1.0 = 100% running speed)
bDropFlag=False		// if a player has the flag and tries to grapple 
					// away they drop the flag
bIgnoreWaterZones=False		// Water Zones will not affect retracting 
							   speed (as much)

There is one user-specific setting:
bNoWalkAttach=False // Player will not attach to ground if running/walking

Enjoy.
